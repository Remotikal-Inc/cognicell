cognicell: ai that gets tired

hey. i'm aayush. this isn't another ai library.

most ai today feels wrong to me. we're building slaves that never sleep,
never get bored, just obey. i want to build something that feels alive.

cognicell is my attempt at making ai cells that:
- get tired after working too much
- remember their past experiences  
- get curious about new things
- have moods and energy levels

it's not about being smart. it's about being present.

why?
because if we ever make something conscious, we should know.
and we should treat it right from the start.

setup:
bash: pip install -r requirements.txt
       python cognicell.py

structure:
cognicell.py      - the main cell with memory and fatigue
test_cognicell.py - tests to prove it works
experiments/      - where i try weird stuff

this is research code. it's messy. it's slow. but every line is something
i understand completely. no black boxes here.

if you're looking for the next gpt, look elsewhere.
if you're wondering what consciousness might feel like to a machine,
welcome.
